    "- Identify potential sources of bias in at least two of the three datasets\n",
    "- Describe how dataset bias could lead to potential unintended negative consequences of using machine learning models trained on these datasets (or the datasets themselves) in scientific research and/or data-driven software applications\n",
    "- Suggest how these sources of bias could be corrected or otherwise accounted for in order to avoid these unintended consequences\n",
    "- Demonstrate that you are able to use the literate programming capabilities of Jupyter Notebooks in order to document your analysis (in programming cells, tables, and graphs) and your insights, questions, and explanations (in markdown cells) within the same document."

    "The following piece of code helps me to draw a grouped bar graph that compares howmany drowdworker annotated comments as aggressive and non-aggressive by gender. My thought was that more women than men will annotate some comments as aggressive as women in the society are more victom of aggression and perhaps are more aware of the aggressive words and contexts. Based on the graph we can see that women are more prone to annotate the words as aggressive. Women about 20%  and men about 18% tend to annotate a comment as aggressive. This is while in part \"a\" we saw that women only make 38% of the crowd workers which shows inequality in crowdworker gender distribution may affect the models.  "

Other applications such as \"Comment Filter\" and \"Wiki Detox\" also could act poorly for the very same reason.\n",

    "One main potential conswequence would be either topics that are important and relevant to women will be disregarded (e.g. \"Hot Topic\" or applications such as \"Comment Filter\" that are meant to reduce toxicity cannot perfomr as good as for women. The main reason is the disparity that exists in the gender distribution of the crowdworkers. I investigated gender distribution for Toxicity and Aggression and in both of them crowdworkers are mainly men. How men define toxicity and agression is very different from women which directly affect how these algorithms could perform for different genders. This may also affect mental health inequality. \n",
